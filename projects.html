<h1>Check out these three projects</h1>


  <div class="card-group">
   
    <div class="card">
      <a href="https://github.com/serobabrahamian/PacMan-Exercise"><img src="PacMan1.png" class="card-img-top" alt="..."></a>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">PacMan Exercise</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This Project has a few components. You are required to use images and call them in your files in order
           to create PacMen. We use HTML and CSS to create a couple of buttons. These buttons have two functions, in which we use
            JavaScript to make them work. One button creates a new PacMan on the screem, the other makes the PacMen move in a
             randomized pattern and speed.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <a href="https://github.com/serobabrahamian/Eye-Exercise"><img src="eye_exercise.png" class="card-img-top" alt="..."></a>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">The Eye Exercise</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In this project we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create two images that look like a set of eyes.
           With the JavaScript code, the set of eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer wherever it goes on the web-browser. You may
            easily change the colors and other styling related things with the CSS document. The HTML document creates a few divs
             in order to make sure the eyes are centered, next to each other, and so it works properly when minimizing the size of
              the window on a PC. The Javascript file, provides the code in order to have the eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <a href="https://github.com/serobabrahamian/Live-Bus-Tracker"><img src="map_of_boston.png" class="card-img-top" alt="..."></a>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Live Bus Tracker</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and APIs (Application Programming Interface). We use Google Maps
           and its interface to show a live-feed of the buses in the Boston, Massachussetts area. Thanks to the Massachussetts Bay
            Transport Authority, the location of the buses are available through their web-site and come in object-form with
             latitude and longitude. Markers on the map are created and the user can track the buses visually by using all these
              tools together.

          For this project you would need to create a Google Account and create an API key which you may then use to access their
           Maps on your web-site (up to a certain amount of fetches are free). So in JS document attached, you need to enter your
            own key for the project to work. Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide our personal key for you to use.</p>
