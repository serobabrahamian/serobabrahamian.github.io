This is my project portfolio page. Whoever is interested can come to this website and check out my history of projects. 

## Roadmap
As of April 2023, I have listed Pacman Exercise, Eye Exercise, and Live Bus Tracker Exercise onto my website. As my career advances, I will list the projects and all the
necessary files online onto my github page.
